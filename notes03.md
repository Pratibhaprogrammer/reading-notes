# git
- git stores data in a file sytem made up of snap shots.  Each time you use "commit" Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. It tracks all your changes and keeps data safe.  
- files can reside in three states: committed, modified, and stages
committed: data is securely stored in a local database, Modified: file has been changed but not committed, Staged: flagged a file's changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
