- access content
- modify content 
- program rules
- react to events
- create slide shows
- filter data
- reload parts of a page
- create forms
- a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to complete a goal.  like a recipe
- to write a script you must first state a gaoland then list the tasks needed to complete it.  computers need highly detailed instructions to complete tasks.
- Start with the big picture.  define the goal, design the script, code each step.
- using a flow chart can help to understand the bigger concept of the tasks.  then you can lay out steps for each task.  
- tasks are then written in code. 
- syntax is how you put words together to create instructions the computer can follow. 
# expressions
- expressions that just assign a value to a variable. this is done with a = ex. var color = 'beige';
- two or more values- var area = 3*2;
- operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
greeting = 'hi + 'molly';
- comparison operators combine two values and return true or false.  buy = 3 > 5;  the value of buy is false
- arithmetic operators.  + adds values together, - subtracts, / divides, * multiplies, ++ adds one to the current number, -- subtracts one from the current number, % divides and returns the remainder
- string operator is a +.  it joins strings on either side of it ex. var fullName + firstName + lastName;
# functions
- group a series of statements together to perform a task.  you can reuse the funtion rather than repeating the same set of statements
- you can wrap a code in a function
funtion key word. give it a name
ex. function askUserName(){code}
- invoking the fuction, call the function name functionName()
- what happens in the function stays in the function
- return statement ex. return userName;  this sends the value out of the function
