# What google learned from it's quest to build the perfect team
- This was an aritcle about researching what makes up the perfect team.  The gist that I got from this was that it really depends on the group.  It is important that we feel seen and heard, and that our personal needs are met.  when we feel safe in a group we are more capeable of making meaninful contributions.
