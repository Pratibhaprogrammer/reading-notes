# Sending Form Data

  ## Clent/server architecture
  - Request response cycle
  - ![](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data/client-server.png)
### Action attribute
  - The action attribute defines where the data gets sent.  It's value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. 
  if this isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form - the cuttent page. 
  - in this example the data is sent to the absolute URL - ```
  https://example.com
  ```
  ```
  <form action="https://example.com">
  ```
- Here, we use a relative URL â€” the data is sent to a different URL on the same origin:
```
<form action="/somewhere_else">
```
- When specified with no attributes, as below, the <form> data is sent to the same page that the form is present on:
```
<form>
```
## Method attribute
- The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method

***get method***
- The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL

```
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```
***Post method***
- The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

```
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="POST">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```
- 
When the form is submitted using the POST method, you get no data appended to the URL, and the HTTP request looks like so, with the data included in the request body instead:
```
POST / HTTP/2.0
Host: foo.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13

say=Hi&to=Mom
```
