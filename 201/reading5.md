# images
- <!---<img> 
To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
  - src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file.
- alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
- title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element
to provide additional information
about the image
  - <!---<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
 <!---quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
 marsupial that is similar in size to the
 domestic cat." />--->

# image height & width
- height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
- width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.
  - <!---<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
 <!---quokka" width="600" height="450" />--->

 ## old code for aligning
 - align 
The align attribute was
commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should
flow around an image 
  - <!---<p><img src="images/bird.gif" alt="Bird" width="100"
<!---height="100" align="left" />T--->

  -  The <!---<img> --->element is used to add images to a
web page.
X You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
X You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
X Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.


 ## Color
 - RGB Values
Values for red, green, and blue
are expressed as numbers
between 0 and 255.
rgb(102,205,170)
This color is made up of the
following values:
102 red
205 green
170 blue
- Hex Codes
Hex values represent values
for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.
#66cdaa
The value of the red, 102, is
expressed as 66 in hexadecimal
code. The 205 of the green is
expressed as cd and the 170 of
the blue equates to aa.
- Color Names Colors are represented by
predefined names. However,
they are very limited in number.
MediumAquaMarine
There are 147 color names
supported by browsers (this
color is MediumAquaMarine).
Most consider this to be a
limited color palette, and it is
hard to remember the name for
each of the colors so (apart from
white and black) they are not
commonly used.
  -  Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
  - There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
  - Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
  - It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
  - CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
  - CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
