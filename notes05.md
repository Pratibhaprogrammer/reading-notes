# chapter 10 CSS
- associates style rules with HTML elemtents
- rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.  A CSS rule contains two parts: selector and declaration
P {
    font-family: arial;}
- selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.  The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.  
- declarations indicate how the elements reffered to in the selector should be styled.  Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon. 
    
- CSS properties affect how elements are Displayed. they sit inside the curly brackets {} and are made up of a property and a value, separated by a colon.  you can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi colon.  {Font-family: Arial; Color: yellow; }
- properties indicate the aspect of the element you want to change.  ex. color, font, width, height, boarder.
- values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. ex. if you specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text.
